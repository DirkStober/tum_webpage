<h2 id="student-thesis">Student Thesis</h2>
<p>If you are interested in one of the following topics, feel free to
contact me about a thesis opportunity (GR/BA/MA):</p>
<h3 id="open-source-fpgaeda-tools">Open-Source FPGA/EDA tools</h3>
<p>I want to explore the usability, availability and performance of open
source tools, as an alternative to the commonly used proprietary
toolchains (Vivado,Vitis HLS etc.). You would use existing designs or
implement simple example designs to evaluate a single open-source tool,
for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>HLS: <a href="https://github.com/ferrandi/PandA-bambu">Panda
Bambu</a></li>
<li>Synthesis: [Yosys] (https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys)</li>
<li>Place+Route: [VTR] (https://verilogtorouting.org/), [nextpnr]
(https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr)</li>
</ul>
<p>or evaluate a complete pass from either C++ or Verilog to a post
P&amp;R representation that can be converted to a bitstream. <strong>You
should be interested in understanding EDA tools and experience in
developing for FPGAs, as extensive manual configuration of the
toolchains will be required due to the incomplete nature of these
projects.</strong></p>
