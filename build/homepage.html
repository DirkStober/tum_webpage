<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>
<p>I give a practical course, that I have designed as part of the BB-KI
project during the Summer Semester, and a Seminar during the Winter
Semester. You can find more information about the courses on the Chair’s
website or by sending me an email.</p>
<h4 id="practical-accelerating-cnns-using-pl-ss">Practical Accelerating
CNNs using PL (SS)</h4>
<p>The course aims at teaching the relevant skills for students to
develop their own FPGA designs using HLS. It consists of a weekly
lecture and accompanying labs. It is roughly split into the following
blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital Design &amp; FPGAs: Recaps Digital Design Basics and
introduces building blocks of FPGAs. Students use SystemVerilog and
Vivado to synthesize simple designs</li>
<li>High-Level Synthesis: Main part of the course covers writing HLS
code, simulation, implementation as well as integration on a Zynq board
using XRT.</li>
<li>Project Accelerating CNNs: Students accelerate a simple CNN starting
from a provided C++ implementation. We use the PYNQZ2 board to implement
the design</li>
</ul>
<h4
id="seminar-on-integration-and-development-of-hardware-accelerators-ws">Seminar
on Integration and Development of Hardware Accelerators (WS)</h4>
<p>In the seminar students can pick between different topics, or suggest
their own topics to the area. Students prepare a literature survey or
replicate parts of existing research and present their results in form
of a report and a presentation.</p>
<h2 id="student-thesis-grbama">Student Thesis (GR/BA/MA)</h2>
<p>If you are interested in one of the following topics, feel free to
contact me about a thesis opportunity. Most of the topics require
<strong>previous experience</strong> in FPGA development. In addition, I
will also supervise external theses if the topic is related to FPGAs,
EDA or embedded systems.</p>
<h4 id="open-source-fpgaeda-tools">Open-Source FPGA/EDA tools</h4>
<p>I want to explore the usability, availability and performance of open
source tools, as an alternative to the commonly used proprietary
toolchains (Vivado,Vitis HLS etc.). You would use existing designs or
implement simple example designs to evaluate a single open-source tool,
for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>HLS: <a href="https://github.com/ferrandi/PandA-bambu">Panda
Bambu</a></li>
<li>Synthesis: <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys">Yosys</a></li>
<li>Place+Route: <a href="https://verilogtorouting.org/">VTR</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr">nextpnr</a></li>
</ul>
<p>or evaluate a complete pass from either C++ or Verilog to a post
P&amp;R representation that can be converted to a bitstream. <strong>You
should be interested in understanding EDA tools and experience in
developing for FPGAs, as extensive manual configuration of the
toolchains will be required due to the incomplete nature of these
projects.</strong></p>
